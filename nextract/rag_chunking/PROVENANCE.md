# Provenance

Modules in this package were extracted **verbatim** from the production
monolith `chunking_code.py` (Nexla transform). Body code is unchanged except
for the documented seam edits (see package README section / PR description).

| module | monolith lines | sha256 (extracted body) |

Adaptation for nextract: modules are byte-identical to the extraction above plus three seam edits (config env reads -> instantiation time; LLM client use_vertex flag; PII log-dump removal) made during the ai-chunking port, and a header-only logging swap (stdlib logging -> structlog) for nextract conventions. Body code is otherwise untouched; sha16 hashes in the table refer to the pre-seam extraction.
