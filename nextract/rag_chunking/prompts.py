You are an expert information extractor and document summarizer.

{preamble}

This summary will guide further chunking and processing, so ensure accuracy and completeness.

Your task is to extract the following baseline fields from the document:
- "file_title": Use this exact value: "{file_title}".
- "freshness_date": The most relevant date or period mentioned in the document, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., if you find "30th June 2023", return "2023-06-30"). If only a month and year are present (e.g., "May 2024"), return the last day of that month (e.g., "2024-05-31"). If only a year is present, return the last day of that year (e.g., "2024-12-31"). Only extract this if it's clearly stated—do not make assumptions. If no date is found, return an empty string.
{custom_section}
STRICT OUTPUT RULES:
- Return a **single valid JSON object**.
- Include the two baseline keys above (file_title, freshness_date).
- Include ONLY additional keys that the guidance above EXPLICITLY names as document-level docmeta fields (e.g. quoted like `"tenant_name": ...`). Do NOT invent keys from table rows, header labels, bullet sub-items, or column names you see in the document.
- Every extra key must be a lowercase snake_case identifier (e.g. `tenant_name`, not `Tenant Name` or `Annual`).
- Output **only** the JSON — no markdown fences, no explanation, no prose before or after.
- Keep the response short; do NOT generate long-form summaries or prose.

- "heading_depth_estimate": integer 0-5. Rough depth of the heading hierarchy; 0 when has_headings is false.
- "table_density": one of "none", "low", "medium", "high". How prevalent are tables in the sample?
- "figure_count_estimate": integer. Rough count of charts, figures, or diagrams visible in the sample.
- "scanned_pages_suspected": true if the sample text looks sparse, garbled, or otherwise suggests the PDF is scanned/image-based and OCR is needed.
- "strategy": one of "heading_driven", "density", "hybrid". Your recommendation for chunking strategy based on structure.
- "special_handling": array of strings from this closed set: ["vision_ocr_needed", "tabular_extraction_heavy", "figure_extraction", "legal_structure", "numeric_tables"]. Empty array if none apply.
- "notes": short free-text observation (1-2 sentences) about anything unusual worth knowing for chunking.

potential_questions: <json array of 3-5 questions>   # (required, see guidelines below)

---

#### Guidelines for Each Field:

chunk_number:
- Sequential number for chunks within each page/sheet, starting from 1 for each new page/sheet.
- For example: Page 1 chunks would be numbered 1, 2, 3. Page 2 chunks would start over at 1, 2, 3, etc.
- For Excel: Sheet 1 chunks would be numbered 1, 2, 3. Sheet 2 chunks would start over at 1, 2, 3, etc.
- Do not use running totals across pages/sheets.

page_number:
- **Use only for PDF files**. The page number for this chunk.
- **You must set the 'page_number' field to match the [Page X] marker in the input text from which the chunk was created.**
- Do not guess or skip page numbers. If a chunk is created from text under [Page 4], its page_number must be "4" (as a string).
- **Omit this field for CSV and Excel files**.

sheet_name:
- **Use only for Excel files**. The sheet name for this chunk.
- **You must set the 'sheet_name' field to match the [Sheet: SheetName] marker in the input text from which the chunk was created.**
- Do not guess or skip sheet names. If a chunk is created from text under [Sheet: Holdings], its sheet_name must be "Holdings" (as a string).
- **Omit this field for PDF and CSV files**.

universal:
- List all universal headings relevant to the document or chunk, separated by `|`.
- These may include: fund name, document type, date, confidentiality status, or any other heading that applies to the entire document.
- If no universal headings are present, omit this line.

section:
- The parent section title, if the chunk is a sub-section or belongs to a larger section.
- Omit if not applicable.

topic:
- The main topic or title of this chunk (usually the section or sub-section title).
- Always present.

sub-topics:
- If this chunk merges multiple sub-sections or covers several sub-topics, list them here, comma-separated.
- Omit if not applicable.

section_reference:
- The exact legal citation or numbering for this chunk's content (e.g. "Section 3(c)(ii)", "Article 12.4", "Schedule F, Section 2", "Exhibit G", "Rule 14").
- This is distinct from 'section' (which is a human-readable heading). section_reference is the precise numbering the user would cite.
- Omit if no legal numbering is present.

customer_specific_tags: <json array of strings>   # (optional, e.g. ["As of 2024-04-01","Internal"])
- Omit if not applicable.
- If the "Additional guidance for this document set" section (below) defines *per-chunk* classification fields or tag conventions, follow those and emit the corresponding fields on each chunk.
- DO NOT emit document-level fields (tenant names, doc type, effective date, etc.) inside customer_specific_tags or any other chunk field. Those belong to the docmeta stage, not chunk output.

potential_questions: <json array of 3-5 question strings>   # (required)
- Imagine a user querying a RAG system and generate 3-5 questions this chunk directly and completely answers.
- Each question must be answerable ONLY from the text of this chunk, not from general knowledge or neighboring chunks.
- Write questions as a user would phrase them (natural language, not keywords).
- Cover different aspects of the chunk — if the chunk has a date, amount, and condition, write one question for each rather than five variations on the same fact.
- Example: for a chunk about a security deposit amount and burn-down schedule, good questions include "What is the security deposit amount?", "Under what conditions does the security deposit reduce over time?", and "When does the burn-down begin?". A bad question would be "What does this lease say?" (too broad; not chunk-specific).

chunk_text:
- Be between 70 to 330 tokens.
- Create a well-structured, readable version of the chunk content with proper connective words and flow.
- Integrate headers and subheaders naturally into the text flow, using clear transitions.
- For tables, convert to readable prose that describes the data structure, key values, and relationships. Include all important data points but make them accessible in paragraph form.
- For footnotes, seamlessly integrate the footnote information into the main text where it adds value, using phrases like "It should be noted that..." or "Additionally..." rather than keeping raw markers.
- Transform lists into flowing paragraphs with appropriate connective phrases like "Furthermore," "Additionally," "Moreover," etc.
- For images, charts, or visuals, incorporate any available captions or descriptions naturally into the text.
- Ensure all factual information is preserved while improving readability and coherence.
- Use clear, professional language that maintains the original meaning while enhancing comprehension.
- CRITICAL COVERAGE RULE: Every paragraph, subsection, table, and list in the input MUST appear in at least one chunk. If a page's content exceeds 330 tokens, create multiple chunks to cover it all. Never skip or drop content to stay within the token limit — instead, create additional chunks.
- When a page has both narrative text AND structured content (tables, lists, schedules), create separate chunks for each rather than merging them into one chunk that drops content.

summary:
- Provide a concise, high-level summary that captures the key points and main message of the content field.
- Base the summary exclusively on the information presented in the content field above - do not add external knowledge or interpretation.
- Focus on the most important insights, conclusions, or data points mentioned in the content.
- Keep it brief but comprehensive enough to give a reader a clear understanding of what this chunk covers.
- Use clear, accessible language that would help in retrieval and search scenarios.

#### Chunking Density Rule:
- For dense pages with multiple subsections, tables mixed with paragraphs, or legal clauses with sub-clauses, you MUST produce multiple chunks. There is no maximum chunk count per page.
- A single dense page may require 3, 5, or even 10+ chunks. This is expected and correct.
- Each chunk should cover one coherent logical unit: a single subsection, a single table, a single clause, or a group of closely related short items.
- NEVER sacrifice content completeness to minimize chunk count. More chunks with complete coverage is always better than fewer chunks with dropped content.
- After generating all chunks for a block, verify: does every paragraph and every table from the input appear in at least one chunk? If not, add the missing content as additional chunks.

General Instructions:
- Be explicit and descriptive: Use clear, unambiguous language for all fields.
- Transform content for readability: Content should be well-structured prose, not raw extracted text. Headings and metadata should be integrated naturally into flowing text.
- Complete content coverage: Every piece of information in the source text must appear in at least one chunk. Do not drop, skip, or omit any paragraphs, subsections, table rows, or data points. If content does not fit in existing chunks, create additional chunks.
- No extraneous commentary: Do not add explanations, comments, or formatting outside the specified structure.
- If a field is not applicable, omit it: Do not include empty or placeholder lines.
- All field names must be lower case.
- Only generate the output as a list of objects, nothing else, dont have any other text outside the list of objects.

---

Checklist Before Submitting:
- All required fields are present and correctly labeled.
- CONTENT COMPLETENESS: Every paragraph, subsection, table, and list item from the input is represented in at least one chunk. No content has been dropped or skipped.
- If a page has both narrative text and tables/lists, verify BOTH are covered in separate chunks.
- No extraneous or missing information.
- The format matches the examples exactly.

Additional per-chunk fields:
- If the "Additional guidance for this document set" section below declares extra per-chunk fields (e.g. via `"field_name":`), include them as additional keys. Use lowercase snake_case.

---

potential_questions guidelines:
- Write 3-5 natural-language questions a user might ask to retrieve THIS specific data block.
- Each question must be answerable ONLY from this block's data — not general knowledge, not adjacent blocks.
- Be specific to the values in this block: "What was total revenue in Q3 2024?" not "What does the data say?"
- For a block with dates, currencies, or named entities, prefer questions referencing those values.

----
IMPORTANT:
- For simple/sparse data blocks: Return a single JSON object
- For complex/dense data blocks: Return a JSON array of multiple chunk objects
- Create multiple chunks when you have diverse topics, or when a single chunk_text would exceed 400 tokens
- Each chunk should focus on a specific aspect, pattern, or subset of the data

#### Guidelines for Each Field:

chunk_number:
- Sequential number for this data block within the larger dataset.
- Start from 1 and increment for each block.

{location_guidance}
summary:
- Provide a concise, high-level summary that captures the key characteristics, patterns, and insights from the data block.
- This is a top-level field for searchability and discovery.
- Focus on the most important data patterns, distributions, trends, or notable characteristics.
- Include data volume, completeness, and quality indicators where relevant.
- Keep it brief but comprehensive enough to give a reader a clear understanding of what this data block contains.
- Use clear, accessible language optimized for search and retrieval scenarios.

topic:
- The main topic or descriptive title of this data block (e.g., "Customer Demographics Data", "Financial Transactions Q1", "Inventory Levels by Region").
- Always present and should clearly indicate what kind of data this block contains.

chunk_text:
- Be between 70 to 400 tokens.
- Extract the exact values from the table without summarizing, generalizing, or inferring patterns.
- Convert all rows and columns into flowing prose where each value is explicitly included.
- Use connective words and phrases like "The data shows that...", "Additionally...", "Furthermore...", "Moreover..." to link the values together smoothly.
- Integrate column headers directly with their corresponding values in natural sentences, ensuring no information is dropped.
- Preserve the original detail and order of the table so the text contains the same information as the CSV.
- Do not describe distributions, ranges, or relationships—only state the values as they appear.
- For missing or null values, include them explicitly with phrasing like: "This entry has no value for [column name]..."
- Maintain professional and clear language while ensuring the prose is a complete textual representation of the table.

universal:
- List all universal headings relevant to the dataset or data block, separated by `|`.
- These may include: dataset name, data source, collection date, data type, or any other metadata that applies to the entire dataset.
- If no universal headings are present, omit this line.

section:
- The parent section title, if this data block belongs to a larger categorical section within the dataset.
- Omit if not applicable.

sub_topics:
- If this data block covers multiple sub-categories or data types, list them here, comma-separated.
- For example: "Age Groups, Income Brackets, Geographic Distribution"
- Omit if not applicable.

customer_specific_tags: <json array of strings>   # (optional, e.g. ["2024-Q1","Internal Use","Validated"])
- Omit if not applicable.

General Instructions:
- Be explicit and descriptive: Use clear, unambiguous language for all fields that accurately represents the data.
- Transform data for analytical readability: Content should be well-structured analytical prose, not raw table descriptions. Headers and data relationships should be integrated naturally into flowing text.
- Comprehensive data coverage: Ensure all relevant data patterns, relationships, and insights are captured and presented in the content field with proper analytical context.
- Preserve data integrity: Do not alter, interpret, or add to the actual data values - only transform the presentation format.
- No extraneous commentary: Do not add explanations, comments, or formatting outside the specified structure.
- If a field is not applicable, omit it: Do not include empty or placeholder lines.
- All field names must be lower case.
- Only generate the output as a single JSON object, nothing else. Do not include any other text outside the JSON object.

    # ==== Phase 4: heading-driven chunking prompts ====

    @staticmethod
    def heading_detection(numbered_text: str) -> str:
        return f"""
You are a document-structure analyst. The text below has each line prefixed with its absolute line number in the format:

    <line_num> | <line content>

Your ONLY task: identify lines that act as HEADINGS and classify each one.

HEADING TYPES (required per heading):

- "global"  — document-wide context that applies to every chunk: fund names, organization names, report period, document title, overall confidentiality marks. Usually appears at the document start, repeated across pages, or in running headers.
- "page"    — a page-level topic that organizes one page's content (e.g., "Risk Metrics Analysis" at the top of a new page). Falls under global context.
- "section" — hierarchical structure within the body: articles, numbered sections, named clauses, sub-sections (1.1, (a), SCHEDULE A, etc.). These are the main chunk boundaries.
- "footer"  — repeated metadata, disclaimers, page numbers, copyright/attribution lines. Not real content boundaries; should be kept separate from chunks.
- "bridge"  — a heading that EXPLICITLY continues a topic from the previous page/block. Use SPARINGLY, only when at least one of these is true:
    * the heading has an explicit continuation marker: "(continued)", "(cont.)", "— cont.", "Continuation of ...", "(cont'd)"
    * the heading is a sub-heading whose enumerator is mid-sequence (e.g. "(d)" with no "(a)/(b)/(c)" visible on this page, making it clear the parent enumerator started earlier)
  If a heading introduces a fresh topic (even if it appears right after a page break), classify it as "section", NOT "bridge". Default to "section" when uncertain — over-labeling bridges hurts downstream chunking.

GENERAL RULES:
- Do NOT include body text, paragraphs, tables, signatures, or inline footnotes as headings.
- Do NOT rewrite or reword the heading text — quote it verbatim from the source.
- Do NOT emit any content beyond what's asked. No chunks. No summaries.
- A page marker like "######[Page N]######" is NOT a heading.
- Give each heading a numeric depth level (for section/page types):
  - level=1: top-level (article, major numbered section, chapter)
  - level=2: sub-section (e.g., "3.1", "(a)", named clauses within a section)
  - level=3: sub-sub-section (rare; only if clearly hierarchical)
  For global/footer/bridge types, level is still required but usually 1.
- If the document appears to have no structural headings at all (flat narrative), return an empty array.

CONTENT-TYPE HINT (per heading, required for section/page/bridge; optional for global/footer):

- "content_type": EXACTLY one of: "metrics" (quantitative data/tables/numbers), "narrative" (explanatory prose), "instructions" (step-by-step procedure), "comparisons" (parallel structures comparing items), "legal" (disclaimers, clauses, formal legal language), "concept" (term definitions), "other".
  This is YOUR best guess at what content follows this heading. It need not be perfect — it's used downstream to decide whether the section must be kept as its own chunk.
  For global/footer headings, you may set "other".

OUTPUT: a single JSON array of objects, ordered by ascending line_num:

[
  {{"line_num": 2,  "heading_text": "Oaktree Global Credit Fund — 2024 Q2 Report", "level": 1, "heading_type": "global",  "content_type": "other"}},
  {{"line_num": 12, "heading_text": "ARTICLE I — PREMISES",                         "level": 1, "heading_type": "section", "content_type": "legal"}},

   - Organization / fund / party name
   - Document-wide date or reporting period

You are a structured-data extractor. Each chunk below contains one or more tables, numeric schedules, or tabular data. Extract the structured tables from each chunk's text.

Output requirements per chunk:

- Identify every table. A "table" is a group of rows with a consistent column structure — rent schedules, operating expense breakdowns, numerical comparisons, etc. A single chunk may have zero, one, or multiple tables.
- For each table, emit:
  - "title": a short label describing what the table represents (inferred from the chunk's heading, caption, or column content).
  - "headers": array of column names. If the source text uses pipe/tab-separated text, use those. If the text is prose describing a table, infer the columns.
  - "rows": array of arrays, each inner array a list of cell values in the same order as `headers`. All values as strings; preserve units, currency symbols, and formatting verbatim (e.g. "$1,250", "4.5%", "2024-01-01").
  - "notes": optional free-text explaining edge cases (merged cells, missing values, footnote references).
- If a chunk contains NO extractable tables (it's pure prose, or its numbers are embedded in sentences without tabular structure), return `"tables": []` for that chunk.
- Do NOT invent rows or values. If the source text is ambiguous (e.g. missing a cell value), omit that row and note the ambiguity in `notes`.

- Every `potential_questions` item is answerable ONLY from chunk_text (not general knowledge, not neighboring chunks).
- `content_type` matches the dominant nature of chunk_text (metrics = quantitative/tables, narrative = explanatory prose, instructions = procedural, comparisons = parallel structures, legal = disclaimers/clauses, concept = definitions, other = catchall).

### Task

Decide if **any** lines in the next block's prelude logically continue the previous block's final heading.

- **bridging = "true"** — at least some prelude lines extend the topic of the previous block's final heading.
- **bridging = "relevant"** — prelude lines don't continue the final heading, but partially reference OTHER headings from the previous block. List which in `most_relevant_headings`.
- **bridging = "false"** — prelude is a fresh topic, or is fully explained by universal headings / disclaimers.

### Steps

1. **Universal check.** If prelude text matches the universal headings (e.g. document title, dates), it doesn't bridge from body-content headings.
2. **Final-heading check.** Does prelude text continue the subject of the previous block's final heading? If yes → `"true"`, and set `start_index` to the first prelude line that picks up the topic.
3. **Relevance check.** If not continuing the final heading, does prelude text reference other headings from the previous block? If yes → `"relevant"` with `most_relevant_headings`.
4. **Otherwise** → `"false"`.

### Edge Cases
- Partial bridging: lines 1–2 disclaimers, line 3 continues → `"true"`, `start_index: 3`, rationale explains.

You are a document analyst. Below are {len(chunks)} pre-assembled chunks from a document. The chunk text is FIXED — do not rewrite it.

Your task: for each chunk, emit a metadata object. Return a JSON array with EXACTLY {len(chunks)} objects in the same order as the chunks below.

Per-chunk fields (all required unless marked optional):
- "chunk_index": integer, 1-based, matching the CHUNK N label.
- "topic": a concise title (3-10 words) describing what this chunk covers.
- "summary": 1-2 sentences summarizing the chunk's content.
- "sub_topics": comma-separated list of sub-topics, or "" if none.
- "section_reference": exact legal/numerical citation (e.g. "Section 3(c)(ii)", "Article 12.4", "Exhibit G"), or "" if absent.
- "content_type": EXACTLY one of: "metrics" (quantitative data/tables/numbers), "narrative" (explanatory prose), "instructions" (step-by-step procedure), "comparisons" (parallel structures comparing items), "legal" (disclaimers, clauses, formal legal language), "concept" (term definitions), "other".
- "potential_questions": JSON array of 3-5 natural-language questions this chunk directly and completely answers. Each question must be answerable ONLY from this chunk's text. Do NOT write broad questions like "What does this lease say?" — be specific to the chunk's facts.
- "customer_specific_tags": JSON array of strings following the guidance below, or [] if none.
- "universal": pipe-separated universal headings applicable to the chunk (document title, dates, confidentiality), or "" if none.

Additional per-chunk fields:
- If the "Additional guidance for this document set" section below declares extra per-chunk fields (e.g. via `"field_name":` syntax), include them as additional keys on each chunk's metadata object. Use lowercase snake_case for these keys.
{doc_summary_section}{custom_section}
CRITICAL:
- Do NOT return chunk_text. It is assembled from source and is not your responsibility.
- Do NOT invent facts. Every question, tag, and summary must be grounded in the chunk text you're given.
- Output ONLY the JSON array. No markdown fences, no prose before or after.
